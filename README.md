<title>datapunk</title>
 Data visualization project on Daft Punk, focusing on the exploration of genres that influenced the duo and how this influence shaped their music. The ultimate goal is to create a static page with the analysis results accompanied by a scrolling narrative.

 
The idea originated within the context of a data visualization project at the University of Bologna. The aim is to leverage both libraries like ggplot in R and data visualization tools to create an enjoyable narrative on the musical evolution of the duo. The inspiration comes from samplingdonuts.com, while the data has been collected from whosampled.com.
