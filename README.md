## **Data Punk**

 Data visualization project on Daft Punk, focusing on the exploration of genres that influenced the duo and how this influence shaped their music. The ultimate goal is to create a static page with the analysis results accompanied by a scrolling narrative.

 
The idea originated within the context of a data visualization project at the University of Bologna. The aim is to leverage both libraries like ggplot in R and data visualization tools to create an enjoyable narrative on the musical evolution of the duo. The inspiration comes from [samplingdonuts.com](https://samplingdonuts.com/), while the data has been collected from whosampled.com.

## Let's Have Some Donut!

The Daft Punk were a celebrated French musical duo formed by musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. Active from 1993 until 2021, they gained international fame for their contributions to electronic music and influenced numerous artists and musical genres.

They, too, were influenced by modern music, especially the most active musical currents between the 1960s and 1990s. Many famous pieces were sampled to create some of the duo's most successful singles. The albums "Homework" and "Discovery" are the ones that most prominently featured the use of samples in their production.

This donut chart, reminiscent of an LP (special thanks to Sampling Donut for the idea), represents the Daft Punk tracks that used samples during their production.

## **The Legacy**

The duo was likely one of the most influential groups of the last few decades, but how influential were they, and especially in what genre was this influence felt? And which elements of their tracks were most widely used?

From the graph, it's evident that their influence in electronic music was significant. However, based on the individual elements of their tracks that have been sampled and used across various genres examined, it's even more apparent how the duo influenced not only electronic music but beyond.
